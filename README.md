# weather-app
 
 Created a weather app that uses the OpenWeatherMap to retrive data and display the information when a city is entered. I have used the OpenWeatherMap API and performed a AJAX request using the Fetch API to display information in a card layout. This weather app is reponsive to multiple devices.
